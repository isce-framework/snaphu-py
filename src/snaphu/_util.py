    Context manager that creates a (possibly temporary) file system directory.

    If `dir_` is a path-like object, a directory will be created at the specified

    temporary directory will instead be created as though by ``tempfile.mkdtemp()``.

    If a directory was created this way, it may be automatically removed from the file
    system upon exiting the context manager, depending on the `delete` argument. If the
    directory already existed, it will not be removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dir_ : path-like or None, optional
        Scratch directory path. If None, a temporary directory will be created. Defaults
        to None.
    delete : bool, optional
        If True, the directory and its contents are recursively removed from the
        file system upon exiting the context manager. This parameter is ignored if the
        specified path was an existing directory. Defaults to True.

    Yields
